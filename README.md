PushBackAnimation
=================

Example animation for iOS that sends one view into the background as another view slides up. The inspiration for this was from the National Geographic Parks app (see http://pttrns.com/navigations#/detail/9aea59cfe1987bd644622f88be14aeaf for an example or the app itself).

To see the animation in action check out the animation.gif found in the repo.
